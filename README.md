# Advanced Programming Techniques Projects

This project repository contains a collection of JavaScript and HTML code examples implemented as part of the Advanced Programming Techniques course. Each code example is designed to fulfill a specific functionality. Below is a brief description of each code example.

## Usage

Each HTML document contains the necessary JavaScript code to provide the respective functionality. Users can open the HTML files in a web browser to see how each code example works.

## Code Examples

### cw0 - Counter HTML

This code example creates an HTML page representing a counter. Users can input numbers, and clicking the "X" button increases the counter value.

### cw1 - IBAN Validation Tool

This code example creates an IBAN (International Bank Account Number) validation tool. Users input an IBAN, and clicking the "+97" button appends "97" to the end of the IBAN number. Additionally, there is a function to validate the IBAN's correctness.

### cw2 - Text Input to Object List Conversion

This code example converts a text input into an object list. Users enter a text input, and clicking the "Convert" button analyzes the text input and provides output as a JSON object list.

### cw3 - Inspector Tool

This code example creates an "Inspector" tool. Users can select files and inspect JavaScript objects and classes.

### cw4 - Device Information and URL Check

This code example displays device information to the user and checks if a URL is available.

### cw5 - Device Status and Keyboard Interaction Monitoring

This code example monitors the device's battery status, online status, and keyboard interactions.

### cw6 - GitHub User Information Retrieval Interface

This code example provides an interface for users to fetch information about a GitHub user.

### cw7 - Weather Information Retrieval and Visualization

This code example retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's location and visualizes it.

### cw8 - Weather Information Visualization on a Map

This code example retrieves weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's location and visualizes it on a map.

### cw9 - Image Inspection Tool

This code example provides a tool to inspect the colors of an image.

### hw1 - Data Analysis Interface

This code example contains an interface for data analysis.

### hw3 - Sprite Animation Control

This code example provides an interface to control sprite animation.

### hw4 - JavaScript Code Controlling the Piano Game

This code example controls the functionality of a piano game.
